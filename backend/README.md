# Backend Services Placeholder

This directory is the designated location for all backend API services for the AmberOps Console.

## Architectural Vision

The AmberOps Console monorepo is architected with a clean separation of concerns between the frontend applications (located in the `apps/` directory) and the backend logic. This `backend/` directory is intended to house a robust, scalable, and independent backend application.

While the current prototype uses Next.js API routes within the `apps/web` application to provide a functional backend, the long-term vision is to replace this with a dedicated backend service built with a technology better suited for enterprise-level data processing and business logic.

## Recommended Technology: Java & Spring Boot

A backend built with **Java** and the **Spring Boot** framework is the recommended choice for this project.

### Why Java & Spring Boot?

*   **Robustness & Scalability**: Java's strong typing, performance, and mature ecosystem make it ideal for building reliable, high-performance backend services that can handle heavy loads.
*   **Enterprise-Ready**: The Spring ecosystem provides out-of-the-box solutions for security, data access (JPA/Hibernate), transaction management, and more, which are critical for an enterprise application like AmberOps.
*   **Interoperability**: Java has excellent libraries for interacting with the Hadoop ecosystem and other data technologies that are commonly managed by Ambari.
*   **Talent Pool**: Java is one of the most widely-used programming languages, making it easier to find and onboard developers.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Project Setup**: Initialize a new Spring Boot project (e.g., using the Spring Initializr) within this directory.
2.  **API Development**: Re-implement all the API endpoints currently defined in `apps/web/src/app/api/v1/` as Spring Boot REST controllers.
3.  **Database Integration**: Use Spring Data JPA to connect to and interact with the MongoDB database.
4.  **Switch Frontend Configuration**: Once the Java backend is deployed and running, update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in the root `.env` file to point to the URL of the new Java service.

Because the frontend applications are built to communicate with a REST API via a centralized client (`packages/api`), **no changes will be needed in the frontend code** to switch to the new backend. This architectural separation provides maximum flexibility and allows the frontend and backend teams to work and deploy independently.
