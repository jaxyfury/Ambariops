It includes summary cards for key metrics (Total Clusters, Active Alerts, CPU/Memory Usage) and tables for Cluster Status and Critical Alerts. All data is currently mocked.",- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` - `packages/api/src/mocks/mock-data.ts`,"Replace mock data with calls to a live API backend.",High
"Cluster Management (List & Detail)",Done,"Users can view a list of all clusters and drill down into a detailed view for each one.

All data is mocked.",- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/clusters/page.tsx` - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/clusters/[id]/page.tsx` - `packages/lib/src/types.ts`,"Replace mock data with live API calls.

"Service Management (List & Detail)",Done,"A complete list of all services is available, with functionality to view details for each service. The detail page shows service status, version, and associated hosts. Service actions (Start, Stop, Restart) are simulated and create tasks.",- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/services/page.tsx` - `apps/web/src/app/(app)/services/[id]/page.tsx`,"Integrate with a real backend to perform service actions. Implement the 'View Metrics' link.",High

This uses a Genkit flow and is fully integrated with the UI.",- `apps/web/src/components/cluster-health-summary.tsx` - `packages/api/src/ai/flows/summarize-cluster-health.ts` - `apps/web/src/app/actions.ts`,"Consider expanding AI features to include root cause analysis or predictive alerting.",Medium
"Configuration Management",Partial,"A UI for viewing and editing configurations (e.g., core-site.xml) is implemented.

The 'Save Changes' and 'Compare Versions' features are not functional.",- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/config/page.tsx`,"Connect the editor to a backend to fetch, display, and save real configuration files. Implement the version comparison logic.",Medium
"User Management & Settings",Done,"A complete user management interface is available in the Settings page, including listing, adding, editing, and deleting users.

A monospaced font is used for readability.",- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/logs/page.tsx`,"Implement the 'Live Tail' functionality using WebSockets or long-polling. Connect the search bar to a real log aggregation service.",Medium
"End-to-End & Component Testing",Partial,"A solid foundation for testing is in place with Playwright for E2E tests and Storybook for component documentation. Critical navigation and user flows are covered.","What's Missing: Test coverage is not exhaustive. Not all edge cases or error states are tested. Unit test setup with Jest is present but has no tests.",- `tests/` - `packages/ui/src/stories/` - `playwright.config.ts`,"Increase test coverage across the board. Add unit tests for complex business logic and utility functions. Add visual regression testing.",Medium
"Internationalization (i18n)",Not Started,"The necessary libraries (`react-i18next`, `i18next-browser-languagedetector`) are installed, and a Language Switcher component exists in the header.","What's Missing: No translation files (e.g., `en.json`, `es.json`) have been created, and none of the UI text is wrapped in translation functions.",- `apps/web/src/components/language-switcher.tsx` - `apps/web/src/lib/i18n.ts` - `apps/web/public/locales/`,"1.
