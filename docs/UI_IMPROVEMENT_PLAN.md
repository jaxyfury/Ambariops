# AmberOps Console: UI and Functional Implementation Report

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a report on the key UI and functional features that have been implemented in the AmberOps Console frontend. The goal was to elevate the application to an enterprise-grade standard by focusing on a fully responsive user interface, robust state management, and first-class accessibility. This document outlines the successful implementation of these features.

## 2. Implemented UI/UX Features

### Global Search Bar

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: A universal search bar is integrated into the application header, accessible via a `⌘K` keyboard shortcut. It triggers a modal dialog that displays categorized, real-time results for clusters, services, and hosts, allowing for rapid navigation.

### Responsive and Collapsible Sidebar

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: The main dashboard features a fully responsive sidebar.
    -   **Desktop View**: It can be expanded for full navigation with labels or collapsed to an icon-only rail to maximize content space. Its state is persisted in a cookie.
    -   **Mobile View**: On smaller screens, it automatically transforms into an off-canvas drawer to ensure a clean and usable mobile experience.

### Quick Access Menu

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: A unique, animated "quick access" button is present in the header. It opens a modal with a source-control-graph-style layout, providing rapid access to common actions and pages, categorized for ease of use.

### Header & Core Navigation

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: A sticky header provides persistent access to global controls, including a **Language Switcher**, a **Theme Toggler** (light/dark mode), and a user profile menu.

### Advanced Data Tables

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: All data tables throughout the application are built on a powerful, reusable component with a consistent feature set:
    -   **Filtering & Sorting**: Universal text-based filtering and three-state column sorting.
    -   **View Toggling**: On relevant pages (Clusters, Services), users can switch between a detailed table view and a high-level card view.
    -   **View Customization**: A "Customize" popover allows users to toggle column visibility, reorder columns, and adjust row density and table styling.
    -   **Data Export**: A built-in export function allows users to download the current table view as a PDF or Excel (.xlsx) file.

### Professional Loaders and Indicators

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**:
    -   **Skeleton Loaders**: All data-fetching views display animated skeleton loaders that mimic the final layout, providing a smooth loading experience and preventing layout shift.
    -   **Progress Indicators**: Long-running actions (e.g., in the Tasks page) use progress bars to give users clear feedback.

### User Onboarding Tour
-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: An interactive, guided walkthrough for new users has been built using `react-joyride`. It highlights key UI elements on the dashboard to accelerate user learning.

### Storybook Documentation
-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: Key reusable components from `packages/ui` have corresponding Storybook stories, allowing for isolated development and testing. The setup includes the accessibility addon (`@storybook/addon-a11y`) to run automated checks.

## 3. Implemented Data and API Handling

### Centralized Mock Data

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: All mock data is centralized in `packages/api/src/mocks/mock-data.ts`, providing a single source of truth for development and testing.

### TanStack Query for API Operations

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: All API interactions for the user management feature are managed by TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`). This provides caching, refetching, and a clean, hook-based approach to server state.

### User-Friendly Toast Notifications

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: Toast notifications (powered by `react-hot-toast`) are used consistently across the application to provide non-intrusive feedback on user actions (e.g., "User updated successfully").

---

## 4. Accessibility and Testing

### Comprehensive Test IDs and ARIA

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: All interactive elements are assigned stable `data-testid` attributes to facilitate robust E2E tests. Semantic HTML and proper ARIA roles are used throughout the application.

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright

-   **Status**: ✅ **Implemented**
-   **Details**: A suite of E2E tests covers critical user flows, including authentication, navigation, data table interactions (filtering/exporting), and global feature usage (theme toggling, search).
