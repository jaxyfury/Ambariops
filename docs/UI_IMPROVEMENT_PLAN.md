# AmberOps Console: UI and Functional Improvement Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for enhancing the AmberOps Console frontend. The goal is to elevate the application to an enterprise-grade standard by focusing on a fully responsive user interface, robust state management, complete test coverage, and first-class accessibility.

## 2. UI Improvements

### Responsive and Collapsible Sidebar

-   **Desktop View**: The sidebar will be collapsible, allowing users to expand it for full navigation with labels or collapse it to an icon-only rail to maximize content space. The state will be persisted across sessions.
-   **Mobile View**: On smaller viewports, the sidebar will transform into an off-canvas drawer, ensuring an uncluttered and intuitive mobile experience.
-   **Icons**: All navigation items will feature clear, intuitive icons from the `lucide-react` library.

### Sticky, Accessible Header

-   A sticky header will remain visible at all times, providing persistent access to global controls.
-   The header will contain:
    -   A **Language Switcher** for internationalization.
    -   A **Theme Toggler** for light/dark mode.
    -   A **User Menu** with links to settings and logout actions.

### Professional Loaders and Indicators

-   **Skeleton Loaders**: All data-fetching views will display animated, professional skeleton loaders that mimic the layout of the content being loaded. This provides a better perceived performance and reduces layout shift.
-   **Progress Indicators**: Long-running actions (e.g., service restarts) will use progress bars or spinners to give users clear feedback on background tasks.
-   **Pre-loaders**: A subtle pre-loader will be displayed on initial application load.

### Authentication Pages

-   **Login & Signup**: Clean, user-friendly login and signup pages will be created with clear form validation and links for password recovery.
-   **Admin Login**: A separate, distinct interface for administrative login can be provided if required by the backend authentication scheme.

## 3. Component and Storybook Enhancements

### Complete Storybook Documentation

-   Every component in the `packages/ui` library will have a corresponding Storybook story.
-   Stories will include interactive controls (via `argTypes`) to allow developers and designers to test all component variants and states.

### Integrated Storybook Testing

-   **Accessibility Addon**: The `@storybook/addon-a11y` will be integrated to run automated accessibility checks on every story.
-   **Playwright Addon**: The Storybook Playwright addon will be used to test component interactions directly within the Storybook environment, ensuring that component logic is sound in isolation.

## 4. Data and API Handling

### Centralized Mock Data

-   To ensure UI components are data-agnostic, all static and hardcoded data will be centralized in `packages/api/src/mocks/mock-data.ts`. No UI component will contain hardcoded display data.

### TanStack Query for API Operations

-   All API interactions (CRUD operations) will be managed by TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`).
-   Queries and mutations will be organized into a dedicated services layer (e.g., `apps/web/src/lib/api/services.ts`), providing a clean, reusable, and maintainable data-fetching layer.

### Mock Data Fallback

-   The application will be configured to use MSW (Mock Service Worker) in development.
-   In case of an API failure or when running in a disconnected development mode, the data-fetching hooks will be designed to gracefully fall back to the mock data, ensuring the UI remains fully functional.

### User-Friendly Toast Notifications

-   Toast notifications (powered by `react-hot-toast`) will be used for providing feedback on user actions.
-   Notifications will be context-aware (success, error, info) and will include actionable buttons where appropriate (e.g., a "Retry" button on a failed API call).

---

## 5. Accessibility and Testing

### Comprehensive Test IDs and ARIA

-   All interactive elements and key containers will be assigned a stable `data-testid` attribute to facilitate robust and non-brittle E2E tests with Playwright.
-   Semantic HTML and proper ARIA roles (e.g., `role`, `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) will be used throughout the application to ensure it is fully accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies.

### WCAG Compliance

-   The goal is to maintain 100% compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. This includes color contrast, keyboard navigation, focus management, and semantic structure.

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright

-   A comprehensive suite of E2E tests will be written to cover all critical user flows:
    -   Authentication (Login/Logout).
    -   Navigating to all major pages.
    -   CRUD actions on resources (e.g., acknowledging an alert).
    -   Toggling language and theme.
    -   Verifying error handling and toast notifications.

## 6. General Recommendations

-   **Responsive First**: All new components and pages must be designed and implemented with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a seamless experience from mobile to desktop.
-   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be reachable and operable via keyboard. Focus states must be clear and visible.
-   **Semantic HTML**: Use HTML elements for their intended purpose (e.g., `<button>` for actions, `<nav>` for navigation) to maximize built-in accessibility.
-   **Storybook as Source of Truth**: Storybook should be considered the single source of truth for UI components. All component development should start with a story.
