# AmberOps Console: Project Status Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AmberOps Console project as of the current date. The project has successfully reached its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, with all core UI modules and foundational features implemented and functional against a mocked API layer.

The architecture is split into two distinct applications: a public-facing **`home` app** for the landing page and user authentication, and a protected **`web` app** for the core cluster management dashboard. This separation provides a scalable and secure foundation.

The application delivers a modern, responsive, and feature-rich user experience that not only replicates the core functionality of the traditional Apache Ambari web UI but also introduces significant enhancements in UI/UX, performance, and AI-powered assistance.

## 2. Current Implementation Status

### A. Implemented and Complete Features:

*   **`home` App (Public)**:
    *   A fully-featured, responsive, and modern landing page.
    *   Complete user authentication flow with sign-up and login pages.
    *   Support for multiple authentication providers: Email/Password, Google, and GitHub via NextAuth.js.
    *   Integration with MongoDB for user account storage.

*   **`web` App (Protected Dashboard)**:
    *   **Core Pages**: All primary pages are fully built and functional:
        *   Dashboard, Clusters, Services, Hosts, Alerts, Config Management, Tasks, Activity Log, and Log Search.
        *   A multi-tabbed Settings page for managing users, integrations, and API keys.
    *   **Modern UI/UX Features**:
        *   A responsive, collapsible sidebar for navigation.
        *   A `⌘K`-style global search for finding assets quickly.
        *   A unique "Quick Access" menu for common actions.
        *   Theme toggling (light/dark) and internationalization support.
        *   Advanced data tables with sorting, filtering, column customization, and data export.
        *   An interactive onboarding tour for new users on the dashboard.
    *   **AI-Powered Enhancements**:
        *   An AI-generated summary of a selected cluster's health.
        *   AI-suggested troubleshooting steps for resolving alerts.

### B. Incomplete or Pending Features:

*   **Real API Integration**: The frontend is currently operating on a fully mocked API layer (MSW). The next major step is to replace the mock service calls with live API calls to a real backend.
*   **Secure User API Key Storage**: The UI for users to add their personal Gemini API key is complete, but the secure backend storage and per-request usage logic is not implemented.
*   **Customizable Dashboards**: The functionality for users to add, remove, or rearrange dashboard widgets is not yet built.

## 3. Comparison with Apache Ambari Web

This section compares the features of the traditional Apache Ambari UI with what has been implemented in the AmberOps Console's `web` app.

| Feature Area             | Standard Apache Ambari Web                                  | AmberOps Console (Current Status)                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dashboard**            | Widget-based view of cluster metrics.                       | ✅ **Implemented & Enhanced**. Provides a cleaner layout with AI-powered health summaries and an onboarding tour.                    |
| **Cluster Management**   | Add, remove, and manage clusters.                           | ✅ **Implemented**. UI for adding and viewing clusters is complete.                                                                  |
| **Service Management**   | Start, stop, restart, and configure services.               | ✅ **Implemented**. All service actions are available via the UI, which trigger mock tasks.                                          |
| **Host Management**      | View host status, metrics, and manage components.           | ✅ **Implemented**. Full list and detail views for hosts are complete.                                                               |
| **Alerting System**      | View alerts, configure notifications, manage definitions.   | ✅ **Implemented & Enhanced**. Includes AI-powered troubleshooting suggestions.                                                      |
| **Configuration**        | View and edit service configs with version history.         | ✅ **Implemented**. A dedicated page for config editing and version rollbacks is functional.                                       |
| **Task & Job Viewer**    | Track running operations and background tasks.              | ✅ **Implemented**. A real-time view of running tasks with progress indicators and mock logs.                                      |

## 4. What is Left To Do in Our Codebase?

*   **Backend Integration**: The highest priority task is to swap out the MSW mock API handlers (`packages/api/src/mocks/handlers.ts`) with a real API client that communicates with a live Ambari-compatible backend. This involves:
    *   Creating a real API service layer in `apps/web/src/lib/api/services.ts`.
    *   Handling real authentication and authorization beyond the initial login.
    *   Managing real-world loading states, errors, and race conditions.
*   **Complete Test Coverage**: While a solid foundation of E2E tests exists, unit and integration test coverage needs to be significantly increased, especially for complex components and hooks.
*   **Error Reporting**: Integrate a production-grade error reporting service like Sentry or Datadog to monitor the application once it's live.
*   **Deployment Configuration**: Create production build and deployment configurations (e.g., Dockerfiles, reverse proxy setups) to handle the two-app structure seamlessly.
