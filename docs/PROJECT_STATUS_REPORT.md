# AmberOps Console: Project Status Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AmberOps Console project as of the current date. The project has successfully reached its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, with all core UI modules and foundational features implemented and functional against a mocked API layer.

The application delivers a modern, responsive, and feature-rich user experience that not only replicates the core functionality of the traditional Apache Ambari web UI but also introduces significant enhancements, particularly in UI/UX, performance, and AI-powered assistance.

    *   **Clusters**: List and detailed views for all managed clusters, including resource utilization charts.
    *   **Services**: List and detailed views for all services, with actions for management.
    *   **Hosts**: List and detailed views for all hosts, showing their status and metrics.
    *   **Alerts**: A comprehensive alert management system with a list view for all alerts, a detailed view for individual alerts, and a page for managing alert definitions.
    *   **Configuration Management**: A page for viewing and editing service configurations, complete with version history and rollback capabilities.
    *   **Tasks & Operations**: A view to track the progress of background jobs and operations.
    *   **Activity Log**: An immutable log of all user and system actions.
    *   **Log Search**: A powerful interface for searching and filtering logs across the entire infrastructure.
    *   **Settings**: A multi-tabbed page for managing users, integrations, and API keys.
    *   **Help & Support**: An FAQ and contact page.

*   **Modern UI/UX Features**:
    *   **Collapsible Sidebar**: A responsive navigation sidebar that can be expanded or collapsed to an icon-only rail.
    *   **Global Search**: A `⌘K`-style command palette for quickly finding any cluster, service, or host.
    *   **Quick Access Menu**: An animated, "source-control graph" style modal for accessing common actions and pages.
    *   **Theme Toggling**: Seamless switching between light and dark modes, with user preference saved.
    *   **Internationalization (i18n)**: A functional language switcher supporting multiple languages.
    *   **Responsive Design**: The entire application is fully responsive and usable on mobile devices.
    *   **Advanced Data Tables**: All tables include sorting, filtering, row selection, column reordering/visibility, and data export to PDF/Excel.

    *   **AI Health Summary**: An AI-generated summary of a selected cluster's health on the dashboard.
    *   **AI Troubleshooting Steps**: AI-suggested steps for resolving alerts, available on the alert detail page.

### B. Incomplete or Pending Features:

*   **Real API Integration**: The frontend is currently operating on a fully mocked API layer (MSW). The next major step is to replace the mock service calls with live API calls to a real backend.
*   **User Onboarding Tour**: A guided tour for new users has been planned but not yet implemented.
*   **Customizable Dashboards**: The functionality for users to add, remove, or rearrange dashboard widgets is not yet built.
*   **Deeper AI Integrations**: While the foundation is there, more advanced AI features like root cause analysis or automated remediation are future goals.

## 3. Comparison with Apache Ambari Web

This section compares the features of the traditional Apache Ambari UI with what has been implemented in the AmberOps Console.

| Feature Area             | Standard Apache Ambari Web                                  | AmberOps Console (Current Status)                                                                                                    |

## 4. What is Left To Do in Our Codebase?

*   **Backend Integration**: The highest priority task is to swap out the MSW mock API handlers (`packages/api/src/mocks/handlers.ts`) with a real API client that communicates with a live Ambari-compatible backend. This involves:
    *   Creating a real API service layer in `apps/web/src/lib/api/services.ts`.
    *   Handling real authentication and authorization.
    *   Managing real-world loading states, errors, and race conditions.
*   **Complete Test Coverage**: While a solid foundation of E2E tests exists, unit and integration test coverage needs to be significantly increased, especially for complex components and hooks.
*   **Refine State Management**: Solidify the use of TanStack Query for server state and Zustand for any complex global client state that may arise as new features are added.
*   **Documentation**: Expand Storybook stories for all components and write more detailed developer documentation for onboarding new contributors.
*   **Error Reporting**: Integrate a production-grade error reporting service like Sentry or Datadog to monitor the application once it's live.
