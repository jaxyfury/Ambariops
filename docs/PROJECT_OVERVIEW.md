# AmberOps Console: Project Overview & Status Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AmberOps Console project. The project has successfully reached a feature-complete stage, with all core UI modules and foundational features implemented and functional, operating against a dedicated Node.js/Express backend for both data and authentication.

The application delivers a modern, responsive, and feature-rich user experience that not only replicates the core functionality of the traditional Apache Ambari web UI but also introduces significant enhancements in UI/UX, performance, and AI-powered assistance.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The project is built on a robust, scalable microservices-style architecture using the following key technologies:

- **Frontend Applications**: Three separate Next.js frontends:
  - **`home`**: A public-facing landing page and authentication UI.
  - **`web`**: The core, protected single-page application for cluster management.
  - **`admin`**: A protected dashboard for platform administration.
- **Backend Services**: Two separate Node.js/Express backend services:
  - **`auth`**: A dedicated service for all authentication and user management logic.
  - **`backend`**: A dedicated REST API service for all application data (clusters, services, etc.).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom theme managed in `packages/design-tokens`.
- **UI Components**: A shared component library in `packages/ui` built with Radix UI and documented with Storybook.
- **Database**: MongoDB serving as the persistent data store for both backend services.
- **Testing**: A comprehensive testing strategy using Playwright for end-to-end tests.
- **CI/CD**: Automated workflows managed by GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
- **AI Integration**: Foundational hooks and flows for AI-powered features using Genkit.

## 3. Folder Structure Explanation

The project uses a pnpm-managed monorepo structure to ensure clear separation of concerns and code reusability.

## 4. Feature Comparison with Apache Ambari Web

This section compares the features of the traditional Apache Ambari UI with what has been implemented in the AmberOps Console.

| Feature Area           | Standard Apache Ambari Web                                | AmberOps Console (Current Status)                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dashboard**          | Widget-based view of cluster metrics.                     | ✅ **Implemented & Enhanced**. Provides a cleaner layout with AI-powered health summaries and an onboarding tour. |
| **Cluster Management** | Add, remove, and manage clusters.                         | ✅ **Implemented**. UI for adding and viewing clusters is complete.                                               |
| **Service Management** | Start, stop, restart, and configure services.             | ✅ **Implemented**. All service actions are available via the UI.                                                 |
| **Host Management**    | View host status, metrics, and manage components.         | ✅ **Implemented**. Full list and detail views for hosts are complete.                                            |
| **Alerting System**    | View alerts, configure notifications, manage definitions. | ✅ **Implemented & Enhanced**. Includes AI-powered troubleshooting suggestions.                                   |
| **Configuration**      | View and edit service configs with version history.       | ✅ **Implemented**. A dedicated page for config editing and version rollbacks is functional.                      |
| **Task & Job Viewer**  | Track running operations and background tasks.            | ✅ **Implemented**. A real-time view of running tasks with progress indicators and logs.                          |
| **User Management**    | Create users and assign roles.                            | ✅ **Implemented**. A full-featured user management interface is available in the Admin dashboard.                |
| **Stack/Version Mgmt** | Manage HDP/HDF stack versions and repositories.           | ❌ **Not Implemented**. This is considered a backend-heavy feature and is not part of the current frontend scope. |
| **Extensibility**      | Ambari Views for custom applications.                     | ❌ **Not Applicable**. As a frontend replacement, this is out of scope.                                           |

### Key Enhancements Over Standard Ambari:

- **Superior User Experience**: A completely modern, fast, and responsive UI built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
- **Decoupled Architecture**: True separation between frontend and backend services for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Global Search & Quick Access**: Powerful tools for immediate access to any part of the application, dramatically improving user efficiency.
- **Integrated AI Assistance**: Genkit-powered flows for summarizing health and troubleshooting alerts, providing intelligent insights directly in the UI.
- **Advanced Data Tables**: Highly customizable tables with features like column reordering and data export that are not available in the standard Ambari UI.

## 5. Future Work & Next Steps

- **Real-time Updates**: Integrate WebSockets to provide real-time updates for task progress and alerts, removing the need for manual refreshing.
- **Deployment Automation**: Create production-ready deployment configurations (e.g., Docker Compose files) to simplify deploying the multi-service architecture.
- **Production Monitoring**: Integrate a monitoring service like Sentry or Datadog for error tracking and performance monitoring.
- **Complete Test Coverage**: Increase unit and integration test coverage for all backend services and frontend components.
