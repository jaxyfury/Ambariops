# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the AmberOps Console project. ADRs are short, written documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

Each ADR should be a separate Markdown file, numbered sequentially (e.g., `001-example-decision.md`).
