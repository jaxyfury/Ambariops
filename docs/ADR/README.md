# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the AmberOps Console project. ADRs are short, written documents that capture important architectural decisions, providing context on why the decision was made and what the consequences are.

This approach helps maintain a clear history of the project's evolution, which is especially useful for onboarding new team members and understanding the rationale behind the current design.

Each ADR should be a separate Markdown file, numbered sequentially (e.g., `001-example-decision.md`).
